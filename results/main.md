# Gallup Relative Income Project Results

A person's subjective sense of their own social status predicts important psychological and health outcomes (Adler et al., 2000; Singh-Manoux et al., 2003, 2005; Snyder-Mackler et al., 2020). One salient source of status is income comparisons, which have been studied in psychology and economics using relative income comparisons (Boyce et al., 2010; Cheung & Lucas, 2016; Clark et al., 2008; Clark & Oswald, 1996; Luttmer, 2005). A given absolute level of income may confer different levels of status depending on the income distribution, such that having an income lower than the typical income of a given reference group is negatively associated with subjective well-being (SWB). This effect is operationalized in regression models predicting SWB from the income of a reference group, controlling for a person's own income. Typically, reference group income is negatively associated with SWB, controlling for the (typically positive) effect of own income.
